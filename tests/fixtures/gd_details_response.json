There is some intermittent sizzle. Seems to be the dreaded DAT mistracking noise that plagues transfers where the head becomes slightly out of alignment with the DAT tape. Some folks notice this when transferring, others don't. \n\n(Check out Peggy-O at about 4:35 on. Becomes sizzly and almost flange-like. Other spots and stretches like this as well).","reviewtitle":"bit of ?DAT tracking? sizzle","reviewer":"sbrew","reviewdate":"2010-07-18 18:13:31","stars":"4"},{"reviewbody":"My friends Mike, Bob and I had been hitting various shows throughout this summer and then coming back to our summer jobs, etc.  Bob and I did 7\/18 through 7\/23--a great way to wrap up the summer.  We had bought tix for these Deer Creek shows through tickmaster and they were suppossed to be held at will-call.  Instead they were sent to his house.  This seemed to have happened to quite a few folks as there were many of us swarming the will call line and calling ticketmaster on the nearby payphones.  Does anybody else remember this??  When my friend and I were by the payphones, a solution to the prblem miraculously appeared.  There was a fence directly behind the payphones, and suddenly a hand came up from underneath and lifted it up, just enough for us to slither under!  God bless the person who did that!  There was absolutely no way we were not going to get into that show after paying for tix that were not there for us at will call because of a mistake.  One minute we were completely frustrated, and the next had ducked under a fence and were in--no questions asked!!  We waltzed onto the lawn and enjoyed the hell out of that show--and i recall the sound was fantastic on the lawn that year--you could hear Phil loud and clear.  Help-Slip-Franks was great and the second set was very solid.","reviewtitle":"Interesting day, great show","reviewer":"Jonnycat70","reviewdate":"2010-09-18 19:17:29","stars":"3"}]},
